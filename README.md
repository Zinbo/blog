# Stack to Basics
My [blog](https://stacktobasics.com/), which aims to explain development concepts in an easy to understand format - starting with Java.

It is made with GatsbyJS and is based on [Ammar Jabakji's Gatsby Markdown Blog Starter](https://github.com/ammarjabakji/gatsby-markdown-blog-starter/).

## How can I start this locally?
1. Set up GatsbyJS (tutorial [here](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/)).
2. Run `gatsby develop`
